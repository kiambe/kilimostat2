                        <p>The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development shall strive to provide data to the public by default and free of charge as a public good. While sharing the data with  the public, the Ministry will be guided by the following principles governing management of government open data:  </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>that the data shall be Complete  and not subject to valid privacy, security or privilege limitations; </li>
                            <li>the data shall be Primary data collected at the source, and can be traced to lowest level possible; </li>
                            <li>the data shall be Timely data made available as quickly as necessary to preserve the time value of the data;</li>
                            <li>the data shall be Accessible data available to the widest range of users; </li>
                            <li>the data shall be Machine Processable; reasonably structured to allow automated processing; </li>
                            <li>the data shall be Non-Discriminatory data available to anyone (farmers, women, civil society, disadvantaged groups), with no requirement of registration; </li>
                            <li>the data formats shall be Non-Proprietary data available in a license-free format over which no entity has exclusive control. </li>
                            <li>Open data shall be Reviewable data, that is, there is a contact person who knows about the data and is designated to respond to people trying to use the data or answer to any complaints raised by data users;</li>
                            <li>The data shall be renewable. That is, data created with reference to a base year should be systematically renewed in subsequent years, so that data users can get not only the latest data available, but also the same sets of data collected many years ago</li>
                           
                        </ol>

                        </p>

                        <p>The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development (MoA&LD) is committed to working with other stakeholders to leverage on open data sharing opportunities to transform agriculture through evidence-based decisions and policies, knowledge creation and sustainable innovations, as well as empowerment of the various players in the agricultural value chains.
